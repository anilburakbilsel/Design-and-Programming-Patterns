## Design and Programming Patterns

In this repo, I will be sharing some commonly used design and programming patterns used
in the programming. 

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code

Design patterns are frequently used in Object Oriented programming languages

### Structural Design Pattern

In Software Engineering, Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### Adapter

Match interfaces of different classes

### Bridge

Separates an object's interface from its implementation

### Composite

A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### Decorator

Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### Facade

A single class that represents an entire subsystem

### Flyweight

A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

### Private Class Data

Restricts accessor/mutator access

### Proxy

An object representing another object
